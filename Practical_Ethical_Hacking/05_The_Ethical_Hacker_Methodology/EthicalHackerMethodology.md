# The Ethical Hacker Methodology



## The Five Stages of Ethical Hacking

The following 5 Phases are part of every pentest:

1. **Reconnaissance:** information gathering, active vs. passive (Google, LinkedIn, etc.) 
2. **Scanning & Enumeration:** nmap, Nikto, Nessus used to actively scan a
   network or website; enumeration: look for valuable information, such a
   vulnerable software, open ports, etc.
3. **Gaining Access ("Exploitation"):** use information from enumeration phase
   to gain access to a machine
4. **Maintaining Access:** make sure that we maintain access if a computer
   should be switched off, so that we do not have to go through the process
   again or evel lose access at all
5. **Covering Tracks:** clean up, delete logs, malware, etc.

Steps 1-3 are the focus of the Practical Ethical Hacking course. Steps 4 & 5
will only be shortly be touched upon.
