# Golden Ticket Attacks Overview

When we compromise the `krbtgt` acount, we own the domain. `krbtgt` is an
abbreviation for `Kerberos ticket-granting ticket`. We can use the account to
grant ourselves access to any account or machine on the domain, which makes us
own the domain.

We can use `Mimikatz` to carry out an **LSA dump** with `privilege::debug`. We
need to get hold of the `NTLM hash` of the `krbtgt` account, and we need to get
the `domain SID`.

Once we have both, we can generate a **Golden Ticket**.

Once we have generated this ticket, we can use **Pass the Ticket** to use it
everywhere on the domain. For example, we can open a new command prompt from
anywhere and access any machine in the domain. In the example below, TCM has
listed the contents of the `C:\` drive of a remote machine. One can also use a
command like `PsExec64` to get a shell on that remote machine.

To carry out the Golden Ticket Attack, we need to move `Mimikatz` to the domain
controller first, e.g. by starting a **Python web server** on another machine
and downloading the necessary files from there to the domain controller.
