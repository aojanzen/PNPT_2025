# Introduction

## Course Introduction

There is no direct path into cybersecurity. No IT or cybersecurity background is not a
showstopper.

**Ethical hacking:** hired to hack into an organisation with their explicit
permission to do this.

Based on Heath's own learning path, especially filling gaps where big
organisations have not provided proper training.

**Rough course outline:**

1. Foundations (Linux, Networks, Python, OSINT, enumeration)
2. Hacking Basics (incl. mid-course capstone project and Active Directory, web
   apps, wireless networks)
3. Other (legal, report writing, career advice)

Total course duration (videos): 25 hours

**Pre-requisites:**

* Basic IT knowledge
* Min. 12 GB RAM for capstone
* Wireless adapter that supports monitor mode
* Min. 16 GB RAM for Active Directory lab (cloud solution possible, but slow)

Basic IT and networking knowledge are required. Perhaps take introductory courses
first.

## A Day in the Life of an Ethical Hacker

* **External network pentest:** assessing an organization's security from the outside.
Methodology focusses heavily on OSINT. Bots are scanning the internet 24/7, so 
chances of finding low hanging fruit are low. Instead we seek information about
the organizations structure, e.g. email format, user names, servers, etc. This
is the most common pentest that organizations do, e.g. due to compliance
regulations, but also because they are cheap (ca. 50 hours, incl. report
writing).

* **Internal network pentest:** assessing an organizations security from the
inside of the network. Methodology focusses heavily on Active Directory
attacks (more than 90% of all companies). Also 50 hours, incl. report writing.

* **Web Application pentest:** assessing an organization's web application
security. Methodology focuses heavily on web-based attacks and OWASP testing
guidelines (recommended!). Also 50 hours, incl. report writing.

* **Wireless pentest:** assessing an organization's wireless network security.
  Methodology based on wireless technology (guest vs WPA2-PSK vs WPA2
  Enterprise). 4-8 hours per SSID + 2-4 for report writing.

* **Physical pentests & Social engineering:** assessing an organization's
  physical security and end-user training. Methodology depends on client's
  goal. Might be combined with other pentest, e.g. phishing campaign. Weakest
  element of any organization is always humans. Takes 16-40 hours + 4-8 hours
  for report writing.

* **Other assessments:**
    - Mobile penetration testing
    - IoT penetration testing
    - Red team engagements (often longer lasting, months)
    - Purple team engagements (red team=attacker, blue team=defender, working
      together)

**Report writing:**

* Typically delivered within a week after the engagement
* Highlight non-technical (executive) and non-technical findings
* Clearly understandable recommendations for remediation

**Debrief process:**

* Walk customer through findings (technical and non-technical)
* Let customer ask questions before final report is released (start with a
  draft!)

## Why You Should'nt Be an Ethical Hacker

* **Don't do it only for the money!** You permanently have to stay on top of your game.
* **You have to be willing to study constantly.** Things are always changing,
  you always have to keep learning.
* **Don't chose this field if you are not passionate about it.** Consider to
  only do it as a hobby (HackTheBox, TryHackMe, CTFs, etc.).
* **You have to be a three-headed beast.** You need to be technical in detail,
  but also be able and willing to write a report and present it to both, a
  technical and non-technical audience, especially if you are in consulting.
