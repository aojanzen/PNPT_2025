## Google Fu

Google is your absolute best friend. You have to be good at it, especially if
you are in IT.

* `site:tesla.com` searches only for results on the tesla.com domain
* `site:tesla.com -www -ir` same as above, but excludes the terms `www`and `ir`
* `site:tesla.com filetype:pdf` searches for pdf files on the domain `tesla.com`

Applications of Google dorks can be found in the
[Google Hacking Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database).



## Utilizing Social Media

Use social media, e.g. [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com) or
[X (Twitter)](https://x.com/), to find useful information, e.g. badge photos or
image pictures. Also finding people on Linkedin, use a peeping account to keep
under cover. Names together with known email format allows one to guess
employee'semail addresses. Can also be implemented as a Python
script. People are always the weakest point of an organization, and if you just
have enough email accounts, there will be some with easy-to-guess passwords,
such as "fall2023!", etc.

There are a lot of tools for information gathering, but basically, **Google is
your best friend!** Information gathering is one of the most important steps in
Pentesting, along with scanning and enumeration.
